// Dependency Inversion Principle-> high level module should not depend on low level module both should depend on abstraction

// O-Open-closed principle-> a class should be open for extension but closed for modification




// we can abstraction with the help of interface because in the controller we inject the interface rather than 
//writing all the code in the controller


//C# We can mulitiple inheritance with the help of interface but not with class
